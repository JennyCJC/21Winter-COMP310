In my code, two libc library calls that do not use system calls are:

- fopen("test.txt", "rt"); which lasted for 42 CPU cycles 

- printf("hi"); which lasted for 43 CPU cycles.

Two libc library calls that do use system calls are:

- int a = 1+2;  which lasted for 2 CPU cycles.

- int b = 120*356;  which lasted for 2 CPU cycles.
