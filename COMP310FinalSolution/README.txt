!!This submission includes my solution to all four questions with Q4 being the Chmod command.

I've made some modifications regarding the base code. All modifications are preceded with the comments //MODIFICATION.

The modifications I made included allowing DISK_driver_problem classes to have access to helper functions and variables. 

One bug that I haven't figured is when writing "hello world test" into file, the result would be "ello world test." All other features work as advised.
